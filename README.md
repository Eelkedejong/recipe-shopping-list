## About The Project

This project contains the front-end for my recipe shopping list web-app.

## Project structure

App.jsx is the entry point for the entire app where global systems are initialized
Authentication.jsx is the authentication layer that blocks the app untill the user signed in.
When the user is sign in, the layout.jsx is called. This is the actual app, which only becomes available once a user signed in.
In the layout.jsx, all routes of the app itself are defined. Only after the user logged in, these become available and are loaded in.
